# 🤖 2-DOF Robotic Arm on Differential Drive Robot (ROS 2 + Gazebo Simulation)

This is the final project for a hands-on, project-based ROS 2 course. The application features a fully simulated mobile robot with a 2-DOF robotic arm, designed and built from scratch using URDF, Xacro, and Gazebo.

> ✅ Built and simulated using ROS 2 (Foxy/Humble/Rolling)  
> ✅ All components are modular and launched via XML launch files  
> ✅ Demonstrates integration of TF, URDF/Xacro, Gazebo, plugins, and custom ROS 2 packages
